# Interval Timer

This was conceived as a simple app to run and share complex interval training routines for bicycle or circuit training. It may become fairly bike oriented though, as that's what I do most. It was intended partly to solve a problem I had, and partly as an exercise in writing vanilla JS, something which I rarely get to do in my professional life as an angular / react developer.

I may also use this as a teaching / workshop example. We'll see how it goes.
